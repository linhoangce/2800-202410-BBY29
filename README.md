the .env will require the following variables. (GROQ_API_KEY, PORT, MONGODB_SESSION_SECRET, NODE_SESSION_SECRET, MONGO_URI, APP_PASSWORD, APP_EMAIL, GOOGLE_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET)

You may need a google maps api key for the community and communityPost ejs files

To install download the folder then in a terminal navigate to the folder and run the following

npm i
node index.js

## 6. How to use
To start login/signup from the landing page (if you forgot your password click login and click reset email and fill in you email and follow the instrucitons send to you)
After logging in you can change your info (add profile picture, change username, change email, change password) in the profile, log out, view rank progress

In the main page you can see your tasks and click them to go to the tasks page and reroll tasks if you want to change them or if you completed the task click done and get points

Rerolls are purchasable with in app currency in the shop along with some other things life gift cards, spending points and points are speperate

There is a leaderboard where users can compete for the top 5 to get additional points or rewards

You can also ask questions to an ai chatbot using text or speech to text or get reccomedations for a workout personalized to you after a body scan and you can get coached in proper workout posture by the ai camera

There is also a community page for users to share/see posts

EASTER EGG
In the landing, login, and signup page if you input the konami code Arrow keys [up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right] then [B, A] with no other input in between a mario will jump

## 8. AI Use

We used chatGPT, Groq's Mistral AI, Tensorflow

Groq is used for the integrated ai chatbot
Tensorflow for body tracking
ChatGPT was used to help create some funtions/html (check app.posst('/reset-email')), fix and debug code and give suggestions on solutions to errors

we kept ai simple, it doesnt create data sets and we had limitations with storing the chats and we could not overcome that within the scope of the project

## 10. Known Bugs and Limitations
Here are some known bugs:
* Some navigation buttons may not work yet but we still implemented them to represent the concept and enhance UI design.

## 11. Features for Future
What we'd like to build in the future:
* train the MoveNet model for pose detection so that I can give users real-time feedback on their postures and forms while exercising.
* Tasks generated by AI based on the users' level of fitness and interests.
* Text to Speech - audio streaming of chat and recommendation for users with vision impairment or working out.
